<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>ntroducing schema.rb  

## What is schema.rb?
A simple tool to handle schema migrations.  

## Why?
Since ive started to use more go, and dont really want to go for a full fledged go solution for ORM and databases.  
I decided the best course of action is to simply create a KISS tool to help me migrate databases.  

## How?
Its made in ruby, since i have a lot of time without programming in ruby and i enjoy the language quite a bit.  

## Where is it?
Is still WIP but heres the repo: [schema.rb](https://github.com/ozkar99/schema.rb)  
At the time of writing, schema.rb is just a skeleton and doesnt really do anything other than parsing of the options.
